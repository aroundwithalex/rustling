# Journey to Rust

This repository contains all the scripts that I created whilst I was learning the Rust programming language. To learn Rust, I followed the Rust book available either from the [Rust website](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or from [Brown University](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).
